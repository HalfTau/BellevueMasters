# About This Repository
I'm taking advantage of Target’s Guild program, which fully covers my Master’s in Data Science at Bellevue University (Go Bruins!).
This repository will serve as a long-term archive of my work across the ~10 quarters of the program — assignments, projects, experiments, notes, and anything else I build along the way.

# 📂 Contents
## Jupyter Sketches:
A collection of small exploratory notebooks. These are my practice ground for learning Jupyter, pandas, plotting, and various data science tools outside the context of specific assignments. Mostly experimentation and early drafts of ideas.
## Notes:
Just little reviews on the week. Thoughts, comments, summaries.
